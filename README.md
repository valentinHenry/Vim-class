Vim class
=========

## About
I definitely don't know everything about vim, I'm pretty much learning every
day new stuff, but with this repo, I hope I'll share what I consider useful
when using this wonderful editor.

The cheatsheet is a list of commands and explanations of what I use the most
in vim. It believe that using them increast the rapidity by a factor of at
least nine thousands!!!!

If you find something interesting in it, it's all yours!

## What's in this repo?
- a small cheatsheet (more or less a todo-list for the class) for people to
  find "what was that command he talked about which seemed not useless."
- my .vimrc
- my dream to see one day an ING1 using vim like vim and not notepad++

## Last words
Please, do not copy - paste my vim config without understanding it. It is
pretty much useless to do so, understand what it does, and chose what you think
will be useful to you.

Vim is a tool, not a religion. Emacs is as good as vim (even better considering
that it can emulate vim).
